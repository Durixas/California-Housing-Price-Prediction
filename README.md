# California Housing Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California using machine learning algorithms and conducting in-depth analyses of the importance of each feature in the model.

### Key Highlights

- **Algorithm Development:** Developed algorithms in Python, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), to accurately predict housing prices in California.

- **Geospatial Analysis:** Employed geospatial analysis for feature engineering, creating interactive maps to visualize housing quantities and prices across different regions in California.

- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Delved into the analysis of feature importance within the models, identifying the top 5 factors that significantly influence housing prices.
